# Restaurant-Page

This was a project to create a restaurant homepage, to showcase my understanding of DOM manipulation using Javascript, as well as my knowledge of modules and importing/exporting.

It was a touch tedious creating all of the HTML using just Javascript, but working on each page the benefits of dividing up all of the different CSS and JS pages were immediate. Smaller files made for far easier readability, and using imports and exports made it a lot easier to control scoping and how files affected webpages. 

Now that I've gone through the nitty-gritty, learning how to smooth over these webpack processes will be a big step towards building larger sites.
